    "text": "Introduction\nSeaborn is a Python data visualization library that helps us create visually appealing statistical graphs. It is built over Matplotlib, providing an interface to create graphics. It works seamlessly with Pandas dataframes and Numpy arrays, performing all the necessary calculations on its backend and letting you focus on your plots’ meaning rather than figuring out how to plot them."

    "text": "Installation and Setup\nWe can install the latest version of Seaborn using pip (Python’s Package Manager).\nOpen your Command Prompt/Terminal on your computer and paste the following code to install the latest Seaborn version:\n\npip install seaborn\n\nYou can verify whether Seaborn is installed or not by opening a Python environment (for e.g. Jupyter Notebook) and typing:\n\npip show seaborn\n\nIf your installation fails (i.e. you get a Package Not Found Error), verify that you are running Python 3.8+ versions since Seaborn is supported in only Python 3.8+ versions.\n\n📌 Dependencies\n\nSeaborn has some dependencies that are required for the proper functioning of the library.\nLibraries like Matplotlib, Numpy, and Pandas are the mandatory dependencies necessary for the appropriate functioning of Seaborn.\nLibraries like SciPy, fastcluster, and statsmodels help enhance the features for data visualization."

    "title": "Key Features and Explanation",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Key Features and Explanation\n\n📌 Loading Built-In Datasets\nSeaborn provides access to a collection of built-in datasets. These can be used to demonstrate Seaborn’s functionalities and data visualization capabilities.\nWe can load a built-in dataset from Seaborn using the following code:\n\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\nflights = sns.load_dataset('flights')  # Load the 'flights' dataset\n\nprint(flights.head())  # Printing the first 5 rows of the dataset\n\n   year month  passengers\n0  1949   Jan         112\n1  1949   Feb         118\n2  1949   Mar         132\n3  1949   Apr         129\n4  1949   May         121\n\n\n\n\n📌 Default Colour Themes\n\nSeaborn provides us with some default colour themes and palettes which make it easy to plot visually appealing graphs. We can also create and save our own colour themes and palettes to use them in future.\nSome examples of these colour themes are ticks, whitegrid, darkgrid, dark and white. Some exaples of the colour palettes are pastel, bright, muted and deep.\nThe colour themes seem to enhance the font colour, background colour, gridlines and the overall appearance of our plots to make it look cleaner.\n\nThese themes and palettes can be used in the following way:\n\n# Applying darkgid theme\nsns.set_theme(style=\"darkgrid\", context=\"notebook\", palette='bright')\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\n\nfor y in range(1949, 1960):\n    plt.plot(flights[flights['year'] == y]['month'], flights[flights['year'] == y]['passengers'], label=f'{y}')\nplt.xlabel('Month')\nplt.ylabel('Number of passengers')\nplt.title('Number of Passengers travelling in flights')\nplt.legend()\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above line plot shows trend of the number of passengers travelling over months for years from 1949 to 1960.\nNow let us explore some plot types that work effectively in Seaborn.\n\n\n📌 Regression Plot\nThis type of plot is helpful if we want to study the relationship between variables. Seaborn has a function regplot(), which can be used to plot regression plots, making it easier to understand the relationship between variables and fit a linear regression model for the data.\n\ntips = sns.load_dataset(\"tips\")\nsns.regplot(x='total_bill', y='tip', data=tips, line_kws={'color': 'orange'})  # Create a regression plot\nplt.xlabel('Total bill')\nplt.ylabel('Tips')\nplt.title('Tips in a restaurant')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis above graph tells about how individuals tip varying based on the total bill. The orange line is the regression line which is the best fit line for the data and tries to capture the overall trend.\nThe orange coloured shaded region around the regression line shows how reliable is the regression model of our data. The wider the region, more is the uncertainty of our regression model.\nBy using line_kws we are applying orange colour to our best fit line.\n\nAlso you might be wondering why the darkgrid colour theme was applied even though we have not applied any theme in the above code snippet; it is because once sns.set_theme() is called, it sets the theme as the default theme and applies it all the plots.\n\n\n📌 Violin Plot\nA violin plot is mix of kernel density estimate (KDE) plot and a boxplot. It is very useful in instances when we want to compare statistical data over multiple groups in a dataset. They help to visualize the spread, density, and shape of the data.\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\nsns.violinplot(x=\"day\", y=\"total_bill\", hue=\"sex\", data=tips, split=True)\nplt.xlabel('Day')\nplt.ylabel('Total bill')\nplt.legend(loc='upper right')\nplt.title('Distribution of tips based on days')\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above plot we are comparing the distribution of total bill between males and females for each of the week. The wider area tells us about the concentration of data. It also tells about the shape of the distribution.\nWe are using hue=“sex” to plot the distribution separately based on sex of the customers.\nFurther we are using split=True to split the violin graph into two parts and showing them side by side for an easy comparsion between them."

    "title": "Use Cases of Seaborn",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Use Cases of Seaborn:\nSeaborn is widely used for statistical data visualization in various fields. Its ability to create beautiful, insightful, and easy-to-understand graphs makes it an essential tool for data analysis. Below are some key use cases:\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) EDA is an essential step in data science. Seaborn provides quick insights into datasets using functions like pair plots, box plots, and distribution plots.\n\n📌 Example: Visualizing relationships in the Titanic dataset.\nUse Case: Helps data scientists understand correlations, detect outliers, and analyze distributions in large datasets. import seaborn as sns import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\ntitanic = sns.load_dataset(“titanic”)\nsns.pairplot(titanic, hue=“survived”) plt.show()\n\nBusiness & Financial Analytics Seaborn is widely used in business to analyze sales trends, customer behavior, and financial performance.\n\n📌 Example: Sales trends over time. Use Case: Used in financial analytics, stock market analysis, and trend forecasting.\n\n\nflights = sns.load_dataset(\"flights\")\n\nsns.lineplot(x=\"year\", y=\"passengers\", data=flights)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMachine Learning & AI Seaborn is commonly used to analyze feature relationships in machine learning datasets.\n\n📌 Example: Understanding relationships in ML datasets.\nUse Case: Helps feature selection, model evaluation, and visualizing predictions.\n\niris = sns.load_dataset(\"iris\")\n\nsns.pairplot(iris, hue=\"species\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial & Demographic Analysis Seaborn can be used to analyze population statistics, survey data, and demographic trends.\n\n📌 Example: Gender-wise survival rates in Titanic dataset\nUse Case: Used in government reports, sociology, and market research.\n\nsns.barplot(x=\"sex\", y=\"survived\", data=titanic)\nplt.show()"
