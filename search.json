    "text": "We can install the latest version of Seaborn using pip (Pythonâ€™s Package Manager).\nOpen your Command Prompt/Terminal on your computer and paste the following code to install the latest Seaborn version:\n\npip install seaborn\n\nYou can verify whether Seaborn is installed or not by opening a Python environment (for e.g.Â Jupyter Notebook) and typing:\n\npip show seaborn\n\nIf your installation fails, verify that you are running Python 3.8+ versions since Python 3.8+ versions support seaborn.\n\nDependencies\nSeaborn has some dependencies that are required for the proper functioning of the library. Libraries like Matplotlib, Numpy, and Pandas are the mandatory dependencies necessary for the appropriate functioning of Seaborn. Libraries like SciPy, fastcluster, and statsmodels help enhance the features for data visualization."
