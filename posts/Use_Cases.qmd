EDA is an essential step in data science. Seaborn provides quick insights into datasets using functions like pair plots, box plots, and distribution plots.

ðŸ“Œ Example: Visualizing relationships in the Titanic dataset


import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load dataset
titanic = sns.load_dataset("titanic")

# Create a pair plot
sns.pairplot(titanic, hue="survived")
plt.show()
âœ… Use Case: Helps data scientists understand correlations, detect outliers, and analyze distributions in large datasets.
