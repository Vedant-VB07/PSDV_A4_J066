# Introduction

Seaborn is a Python data visualization library that helps us create visually appealing statistical graphs. It is built over Matplotlib, providing an interface to create graphics. It works seamlessly with Pandas dataframes and Numpy arrays, performing all the necessary calculations on its backend and letting you focus on your plots' meaning rather than figuring out how to plot them.
